# Yanis Guenane


## $> whoami

I am Yanis, I am a Senior Software Engineer at $DAYJOB based in Bordeaux. France. (Yes, where they make the amazing wine).

My main area of focus are automation, testing, cloud and open source. I am always looking for new tools, new pattern to use in those areas.
I like to help communities/associations build/maintain open infra.


## $> misc

Except from IT, I consider myself an #avgeek and traveller addict. I love discovering new horizons, learn new languages and meet & live with new people.
Oh and as the title of this blog says, I tried to lean towards *Simplicity, Pragmatism and Minimalism*. Posts on this blog will hopefully reflect that.
